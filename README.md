>Cleanse yourself before your own eyes lest another cleanse you.

>Those who will rise early and are late to sit down eating bread, in sorrows, are worthless, so he will give his beloved ones sleep.

>The extinction of evil desire is the highest religion

>He whose wickedness is very great brings himself down to that state where his enemy wishes him to be. He himself is his greatest enemy. Thus a creeper destroys the life of a tree on which it finds support.

>Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked; by these three steps thou wilt become divine. Let a wise man blow off the impurities of his self, as a smith blows off the impurities of silver, one by one, little by little, and from time to time.

>Lead others, not by violence, but by righteousness and equity. He who possesses virtue and intelligence, who is just, speaks the truth, and does what is his own business, him the world will hold dear. As the bee collects nectar and departs without injuring the flower, or its color or scent, so let a sage dwell in the community.

>If a traveler does not meet with one who is his better, or his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no companionship with fools. Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a mile to him who is tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true religion. Better than living a hundred years not seeing the highest truth, is one day in the life of a man who sees the highest truth.

>The tenth hindrance is ignorance. When all other difficulties are conquered this will even remain, the thorn in the flesh of the wise and good, the last enemy and the bitterest foe of man.

>Exercise self-control at thy meals, and take upon thyself some duties that will exercise thy abilities and make thee useful to thy fellow-men. In following this advice thou wilt prolong thy life.

>It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love. This is how the whole scheme of things works. All good things are difficult to achieve; and bad things are very easy to get.

>The superior man understands what is right; the inferior man understands what will sell

>The virtuous man is driven by responsibility, the non-virtuous man is driven by profit

>Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for little; by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods.

>If I am walking with two other men, each of them will serve as my teacher. I will pick out the good points of the one and imitate them, and the bad points of the other and correct them in myself.

>To see and listen to the wicked is already the beginning of wickedness.

>When we see persons of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see persons of a contrary character, we should turn inwards and examine ourselves.

>He who acts with a constant view to his own advantage will be much murmured against.

>I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.

>The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this. In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which he is not himself. In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against men. Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, looking for lucky occurrences.

>You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

> A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.

>It is the example of other people that is our undoing; let us merely separate ourselves from the crowd, and we shall be made whole.
    
>Strengthen your drooping arms, and steady your tottering knees. Say to the fainthearted, "Be strong and unafraid! Here is your God; he will come with vengeance; with God's retribution he will come and save you."

>Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and he that loves it will eat from its fruit.

>Because a man walks in an image and he fades away like a vapor; he lays down treasures and does not know for whom he gathered them.        

>I also gave them laws that were not good and rulings by which they could not live; and I let them become defiled by their own gifts

>Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world

>I hate two-faced people, but I love your teachings.

>Behold, if you do right, I accept it, and if you will not do right, sin lies in wait before the door; you are going to be converted to it and it will have authority over you.

>You will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove what is contaminating you.

>I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Therefore choose life, so that you and your descendants may live

>Should the living seek guidance from the dead?

>Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for My name is in him.

>For cetain individuals, the ones written about long ago as being meant for this condemnation, have wormed their way in

>A man will seize one of his brothers in his father's house, and say, "You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!" But in that day he will cry out, "I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people."

>How long must I wrestle in my soul, with sorrow in my heart each day? How long will my enemy dominate me?

>So I took all this to heart and concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their deeds, are in God's hands. Man does not know what lies ahead, whether love or hate.

>But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He will be like a refiner’s fire, like a launderer's soap.

>Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is attained along the path of righteousness. 

>He who is slow to anger is better than a warrior, and he who controls his temper is greater than one who captures a city.

>Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you

>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

>God, with his affliction, delivers the afflicted; and he gets their attention by pressing on them.

>all the earth will be consumed by the fire of my jealousy

>So He will repay according to their deeds: fury to His enemies, retribution to His foes, and recompense to the islands.

>You will run from a lion, only to meet a bear. You will escape to your house, rest your hand on the wall, and be bitten by a snake.

>No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields a harvest of righteousness and peace to those who have been trained by it.
Therefore strengthen your limp hands and weak knees.

>For I tell you, unless your righteousness is far greater than that of the teachers and separated ones, you will certainly not enter the Kingdom of Heaven!

>Your wickedness can affect only others like you, and your righteousness only other human beings.

>If he were to take back man's heart to himself, if he gathered to himself his spirit and breath; all flesh would instantly perish, everyone would return to dust.

>Someone who is already wise will hear and learn still more; someone who already understands will gain the ability to counsel well; he will understand proverbs, obscure expressions, the sayings and riddles of the wise.

>Glean from rich fields, and the armies will have enough to eat

>When you cut your vineyard, you do not glean behind you; it is for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow;

>The one who denies justice to a resident alien, a fatherless child, or a widow is cursed. And all the people will say, Amen!

>But a man, despite his wealth, cannot endure; he is like the beasts that perish. This is the fate of the self-confident and their followers who endorse their sayings.

>Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber's razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take a set of scales and divide up the hair.

>If you lay your hand on him, you won't forget the fight, and you'll never do it again!     

>You clothed me with skin and flesh, and you knit my bones and sinews together.

>Then, when your flesh and bones have shrunk, at the end of your life, you would moan, "How I hated discipline! My whole being despised reproof, I ignored what my teachers said, I didn't listen to my instructors"

>I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.

>The idols of the nations are mere gold and silver, made by human hands. They have mouths, but they can't speak; they have eyes, but they can't see; they have ears, but they can't listen; and they have no breath in the mouths; The people who make them will become like them, along with everyone who trusts in them.

>Ordinary folks are merely a breath and important people a sham; if you lay them on the balance-scale, the go up - both together are lighter than nothing.
>To you, God, in Tziyon, silence is praise; and vows to you are to be fulfilled

>Be careful; turn away from wrongdoing; for because of this, you have been tested by affliction

>At that time Michael, the great prince who stands watch over your people, will rise up. There will be a time of distress, the likes of which will not have occurred from the beginning of nations until that time. But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered. And many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, but others to shame and everlasting contempt. Then the 
will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever and ever.

>All who live on earth are counted as nothing. He does what he wishes with the army of heaven and with those living on earth. No one can hold back his hand or ask him, "What are you doing?"

>Nevertheless I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. There is no one standing with me against them except Michael your prince

>Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. But I have thrown you on the ground; before kings I have made you a spectacle.

>For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself. For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands: for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth: whereas he lived once, but they never. Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others. Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God and his blessing. Therefore by the like were they punished worthily, and by the multitude of beasts tormented.

>For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: for in her is an understanding spirit holy, one only, manifold, subtil, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good, Kind to man, steadfast, sure, free from care, having all power, overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure, and most subtil, spirits. For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness. For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.

>For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom. For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it. For after this cometh night: but vice shall not prevail against wisdom.

>Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things. I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty. In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her. For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works. 

>If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things? And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she? And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as men can have nothing more profitable in their life. If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times.

>Don't think I have come to abolish the Torah or the Prophets. I have come not to abolish but to complete.

>This symbolizes the present age and indicates that the conscience of the person performing the service cannot be brought to the goal by the gifts and sacrifices he offers.

>When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.

>He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signs past, which I have told thee before, then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time, wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made.

>But yet for this they are the less to be blamed: for they peradventure err, seeking God, and desirous to find him. For being conversant in his works they search him diligently, and believe their sight: because the things are beautiful that are seen.

>Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord, his house shall soon be overthrown.

>Like as a whore envieth a right honest and virtuous woman: So shall righteousness hate iniquity, when she decketh herself, and shall accuse her to her face, when he cometh that shall defend him that diligently searcheth out every sin upon earth.

>For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen. But yet for this they are the less to be blamed: for they peradventure err, seeking God, and desirous to find him. For being conversant in his works they search him diligently, and believe their sight: because the things are beautiful that are seen. Howbeit neither are they to be pardoned. For if they were able to know so much, that they could aim at the world; how did they not sooner find out the Lord thereof?

>Return again to the place of judgment: for they have borne false witness against her. Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and the elders said unto him, Come, sit down among us, and shew it us, seeing God hath given thee the honour of an elder.

>For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.
