>Strengthen the limp hands and steady the feeble knees!

>You must not be called 'Teacher,' because you are all equal and have only one Teacher

>The balance and scales of justice have their origin in God; all the weights in the bag are His doing

>Ordinary folks are merely a breath, and important people a sham; if you lay them on a balance scale, they go up - both together they are lighter than nothing

>TEKEL means that you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient

>By your strength you set up the mountains. You are clothed with power.

>Behold, his strength in his waist, and his power in the muscles of his belly.

>His hands are like a fortress city of gold that is full of stones of gold; his belly the work of ivory on the blowing of sapphire

>Human wrath serves only to praise you; what remains of this wrath you wear as an ornament

>She gathers her strength around her and throws herself into her work.

>You provide a broad path for my feet, so that my ankles do not give way.

>Be sharp! Attack on the right, or parry to your left, wherever you point your sword
>
>You are to differentiate between what's sacred and common and between what's unclean and clean.

>Therefore, remove anger from your heart; and keep from harming your body; for neither adolescence nor youth has any lasting value. 

>I am worn out and weak, moaning and in distress

>Thus have We made for every prophet an enemy among the sinners: but enough is thy Lord to guide and to help

>They have bought error in exchange for guidance, so their trade reaps no profit, and they are not rightly guided

>Don't stare at me because I am dark, it is the sun that tanned me. My Mother's sons were angry with me and made me look after their vineyards. But I haven't cared for my own vineyard.

>We have indeed established you on earth and provided you with a means of livelihood. Yet you seldom give any thanks.

>I will approach them from their front, their back, their right, their left, and then You will find most of them ungrateful.

>Those who will rise early and are late to sit down eating bread, in sorrows, are worthless, so he will give his beloved ones sleep.

>Come away quickly, my beloved. Run like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.

>Do not make unlawful the wholesome things which God has made lawful for you, but commit no excess for God does not love those given to excess.

>On the seventh day they must shave off all their hair; they must shave their head, their beard, their eyebrows and the rest of their hair. They must wash their clothes and bathe themselves with water, and they will be clean.

>Now, son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a barber's razor to shave your head and your beard. Then take a set of scales and divide up the hair.

>Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they should not live;

>When you see one who has more, look to one who has less

>But when fear leaves them and they become content, they harm you verbally with abusive sharp tongues

>The extinction of evil desire is the highest religion

>Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing or take part in works of wickedness with men who do iniquity; let me not feast on their delicacies.

>For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies

>He whose wickedness is very great brings himself down to that state where his enemy wishes him to be. He himself is his greatest enemy. Thus a creeper destroys the life of a tree on which it finds support.

>Let a wise man blow off the impurities of his self, as a smith blows off the impurities of silver, one by one, little by little, and from time to time.

>Lead others, not by violence, but by righteousness and equity. He who possesses virtue and intelligence, who is just, speaks the truth, and does what is his own business, him the world will hold dear. As the bee collects nectar and departs without injuring the flower, or its color or scent, so let a sage dwell in the community.

>If a traveler does not meet with one who is his better, or his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no companionship with fools. Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a mile to him who is tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true religion. Better than living a hundred years not seeing the highest truth, is one day in the life of a man who sees the highest truth.

>The tenth hindrance is ignorance. When all other difficulties are conquered this will even remain, the thorn in the flesh of the wise and good, the last enemy and the bitterest foe of man.

>Exercise self-control at thy meals, and take upon thyself some duties that will exercise thy abilities and make thee useful to thy fellow-men. In following this advice thou wilt prolong thy life.

>It is easy to hate and it is difficult to love. This is how the whole scheme of things works. All good things are difficult to achieve; and bad things are very easy to get.

>The superior man understands what is right; the inferior man understands what will sell

>The virtuous man is driven by responsibility, the non-virtuous man is driven by profit

>Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for little; by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods.

>If I am walking with two other men, each of them will serve as my teacher. I will pick out the good points of the one and imitate them, and the bad points of the other and correct them in myself.

>To see and listen to the wicked is already the beginning of wickedness.

>When we see persons of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see persons of a contrary character, we should turn inwards and examine ourselves.

>He who acts with a constant view to his own advantage will be much murmured against.

>I do not open up the truth to one who is not eager to get knowledge, nor help out any one who is not anxious to explain himself. When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.

>The superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is; he does not desire to go beyond this. In a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position of wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper to a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does what is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position of sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of sorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation in which he is not himself. In a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors. In a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors. He rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he has no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble against men. Thus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the appointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths, looking for lucky occurrences.

>Five of the curtains are to be joined together, and the other five joined as well. Make loops of blue material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and do the same for the end curtain in the second set. Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops line up opposite one another. Make fifty gold clasps as well, and join the curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle will be a unit.

>You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.

> A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.

>It is the example of other people that is our undoing; let us merely separate ourselves from the crowd, and we shall be made whole.
    
>Strengthen your drooping arms, and steady your tottering knees. Say to the fainthearted, "Be strong and unafraid! Here is your God; he will come with vengeance; with God's retribution he will come and save you."

>Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and he that loves it will eat from its fruit.

>Because a man walks in an image and he fades away like a vapor; he lays down treasures and does not know for whom he gathered them.        

>I also gave them laws that were not good and rulings by which they could not live; and I let them become defiled by their own gifts

>Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world

>I hate two-faced people, but I love your teachings.

>Behold, if you do right, I accept it, and if you will not do right, sin lies in wait before the door; you are going to be converted to it and it will have authority over you.

>You will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove what is contaminating you.

>I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Therefore choose life, so that you and your descendants may live

>Should the living seek guidance from the dead?

>Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for My name is in him.

>For certain individuals, the ones written about long ago as being meant for this condemnation, have wormed their way in

>A man will seize one of his brothers in his father's house, and say, "You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!" But in that day he will cry out, "I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people."

>How long must I wrestle in my soul, with sorrow in my heart each day? How long will my enemy dominate me?

>So I took all this to heart and concluded that the righteous and the wise, as well as their deeds, are in God's hands. Man does not know what lies ahead, whether love or hate.

>But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He will be like a refiner’s fire, like a launderer's soap.

>Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is attained along the path of righteousness. 

>He who is slow to anger is better than a warrior, and he who controls his temper is greater than one who captures a city.

>Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you

>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

>God, with his affliction, delivers the afflicted; and he gets their attention by pressing on them.

>all the earth will be consumed by the fire of my jealousy

>So He will repay according to their deeds: fury to His enemies, retribution to His foes, and recompense to the islands.

>You will run from a lion, only to meet a bear. You will escape to your house, rest your hand on the wall, and be bitten by a snake.

>No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields a harvest of righteousness and peace to those who have been trained by it.
Therefore strengthen your limp hands and weak knees.

>For I tell you, unless your righteousness is far greater than that of the teachers and separated ones, you will certainly not enter the Kingdom of Heaven!

>Your wickedness can affect only others like you, and your righteousness only other human beings.

>If he were to take back man's heart to himself, if he gathered to himself his spirit and breath; all flesh would instantly perish, everyone would return to dust.

>Someone who is already wise will hear and learn still more; someone who already understands will gain the ability to counsel well; he will understand proverbs, obscure expressions, the sayings and riddles of the wise.

>Glean from rich fields, and the armies will have enough to eat

>When you cut your vineyard, you do not glean behind you; it is for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow;

>The one who denies justice to a resident alien, a fatherless child, or a widow is cursed. And all the people will say, Amen!

>But a man, despite his wealth, cannot endure; he is like the beasts that perish. This is the fate of the self-confident and their followers who endorse their sayings.

>If you lay your hand on him, you won't forget the fight, and you'll never do it again!     

>You clothed me with skin and flesh, and you knit my bones and sinews together.

>Then, when your flesh and bones have shrunk, at the end of your life, you would moan, "How I hated discipline! My whole being despised reproof, I ignored what my teachers said, I didn't listen to my instructors"

>I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.

>The idols of the nations are mere gold and silver, made by human hands. They have mouths, but they can't speak; they have eyes, but they can't see; they have ears, but they can't listen; and they have no breath in the mouths; The people who make them will become like them, along with everyone who trusts in them.

>Ordinary folks are merely a breath and important people a sham; if you lay them on the balance-scale, the go up - both together are lighter than nothing.
>To you, God, in Tziyon, silence is praise; and vows to you are to be fulfilled

>Be careful; turn away from wrongdoing; for because of this, you have been tested by affliction

>At that time Michael, the great prince who stands watch over your people, will rise up. There will be a time of distress, the likes of which will not have occurred from the beginning of nations until that time. But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered. And many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, but others to shame and everlasting contempt. Then the 
will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever and ever.

>All who live on earth are counted as nothing. He does what he wishes with the army of heaven and with those living on earth. No one can hold back his hand or ask him, "What are you doing?"

>Nevertheless I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. There is no one standing with me against them except Michael your prince

>Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. But I have thrown you on the ground; before kings I have made you a spectacle.

>For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself. For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands: for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth: whereas he lived once, but they never. Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others. Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God and his blessing. Therefore by the like were they punished worthily, and by the multitude of beasts tormented.

>For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: for in her is an understanding spirit holy, one only, manifold, subtil, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good, Kind to man, steadfast, sure, free from care, having all power, overseeing all things, and going through all understanding, pure, and most subtil, spirits. For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness. For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.

>For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom. For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it. For after this cometh night: but vice shall not prevail against wisdom.

>Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things. I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty. In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her. For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works. 

>If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things? And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she? And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as men can have nothing more profitable in their life. If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times.

>Don't think I have come to abolish the Torah or the Prophets. I have come not to abolish but to complete.

>This symbolizes the present age and indicates that the conscience of the person performing the service cannot be brought to the goal by the gifts and sacrifices he offers.

>When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.

>He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the time diligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signs past, which I have told thee before, then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time, wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made.

>But yet for this they are the less to be blamed: for they peradventure err, seeking God, and desirous to find him. For being conversant in his works they search him diligently, and believe their sight: because the things are beautiful that are seen.

>Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord, his house shall soon be overthrown.

>Like as a whore envieth a right honest and virtuous woman: So shall righteousness hate iniquity, when she decketh herself, and shall accuse her to her face, when he cometh that shall defend him that diligently searcheth out every sin upon earth.

>For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen. But yet for this they are the less to be blamed: for they peradventure err, seeking God, and desirous to find him. For being conversant in his works they search him diligently, and believe their sight: because the things are beautiful that are seen. Howbeit neither are they to be pardoned. For if they were able to know so much, that they could aim at the world; how did they not sooner find out the Lord thereof?

>Return again to the place of judgment: for they have borne false witness against her. Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and the elders said unto him, Come, sit down among us, and shew it us, seeing God hath given thee the honour of an elder.

>For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.

>Go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thine appetites.

>As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is he that executeth judgment with violence.

>Let not the greediness of the belly nor lust of the flesh take hold of me; and give not over me thy servant into an impudent mind. Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth: he that keepeth it shall never be taken in his lips.

>The worldling nourishes his body, but the wise man nourishes his mind. He who indulges in the satisfaction of his appetites works his own destruction; but he who walks in the path will have both the salvation from evil and a prolongation of life.

>How you turn things upside down! Is the potter not better than the clay? Does something made say to its maker, "He didn't make me"? Does the product say of its producer, "He has no discernment."

>Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous; neither with a coward in matters of war; nor with a merchant concerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an envious man of thankfulness; nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; nor with the slothful for any work; nor with an hireling for a year of finishing work; nor with an idle servant of much business: hearken not unto these in any matter of counsel.

>Formerly the master selected the slave; today the slave selects his master

>a slave owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man - are they equal in comparison

>My son, keep the flower of thine age sound; and give not thy strength to strangers. When thou hast gotten a fruitful possession through all the field, sow it with thine own seed, trusting in the goodness of thy stock. So thy race which thou leavest shall be magnified, having the confidence of their good descent.

>And therefore they that labour labour in vain: For strangers shall reap their fruits, and spoil their goods, overthrow their houses, and take their children captives, for in captivity and famine shall they get children.

>For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honored him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices. Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings.

>Sound sleep cometh of moderate eating: he riseth early, and his wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and choler, and pangs of the belly, are with an unsatiable man.

>There was one who pleased God and was loved by him, and while living among sinners he was taken up. He was caught up lest evil change his understanding or guile deceive his soul. For the fascination of wickedness obscures what is good, and roving desire perverts the innocent mind.

>Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not suddenly by them, and that my tongue destroy me not?

>A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees.

>And I beheld, and, lo, that man waxed strong with the thousands of heaven: and when he turned his countenance to look, all the things trembled that were seen under him.

>Let go from thee mortal thoughts, cast away the burdens of man, put off now the weak nature, and set aside the thoughts that are most heavy unto thee, and haste thee to flee from these times. For yet greater evils than those which thou hast seen happen shall be done hereafter. For look how much the world shall be weaker through age, so much the more shall evils increase upon them that dwell therein.

>What hath pride profited us: or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us: All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a post that hasted by; And as a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither the pathway of the keel in the waves; Or as when a bird hath flown through the air, there is no token of her way to be found, but the light air being beaten with the stroke of her wings, and parted with the violent noise and motion of them, is passed through, and therein afterwards no sign where she went is to be found

>Give not over thy mind to heaviness, and afflict not thyself in thine own counsel. 

>The gladness of the heart is the life of man, and the joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days. Love thine own soul, and comfort thy heart, remove sorrow far from thee: for sorrow hath killed many, and there is no profit therein.

>Envy and wrath shorten the life, and carefulness bringeth age before the time. A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat and diet.

>He created me from the beginning before the world, and I shall never fail.

>Sometimes you can become rich by being generous, or poor by being greedy.

>They will always be remembered and greatly praised, because they were kind and freely gave to the poor
>But the midwives feared Elohim, and did not do as the sovereign of Mitsrayim commanded them, and kept the male children alive.

>Do not stand in a place of danger trusting in miracles

>The man who has confidence in himself gains the confidence of others

>Our bodies ache during the day, and work is torture. Then at night our thoughts are troubled. It just doesn't make sense

>You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.

>For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it shall pour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon them strange calamities, and overthrew them utterly.

>He that hath small understanding, and feareth God, is better than one that hath much wisdom, and transgresseth the law of the most High.

>Who shall praise the most High in the grave, instead of them which live and give thanks?

>Every man from his youth is given to evil; neither could they make to themselves fleshy hearts for stony.

>The alms of a man is as a signet with him, and he will keep the good deeds of man as the apple of the eye, and give repentance to his sons and daughters.

>They accepted none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof. So they will eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.

>She does not consider the path of life; she does not know that her ways are unstable.

>Do not hand a Servant over to his Master who has fled to you from his Master:

>And they gave a thousand of every tribe, that is to say, twelve thousand men well appointed for battle.

>So he measured all four sides. There was a wall all around it. The wall was 875 feet long and 875 feet wide. It separated what was holy from what was unholy.

>I cannot carry this whole nation! The burden is too heavy for me! And if thus You are doing to me—please slay me; slay, if I have found grace in your eyes, and do not let me look on my affliction.

>The main thing about your word is that it is true;
>and all your just rulings last forever.

>Better to eat vegetables with people you love than to eat the finest meat where there is hate.

>Whoever thinks that God will not help him in this life and in the Hereafter—let him turn to heaven, then sever, and see if his cunning eliminates what enrages him.
>
>Make sure that there is no one here today who hears these solemn demands and yet convinces himself that all will be well with him, even if he stubbornly goes his own way. That would destroy all of you, good and evil alike.

>I have walked in your road without blemish. When will you come to me? I have walked in the perfection of my heart within my house.

>But what could I say? For he himself sent this sickness. Now I will walk humbly throughout my years because of this anguish I have felt.

>I will run in the way of Your commandments, for You broaden my understanding.

>A muddied spring or a polluted well — that's what a righteous person is who compromises with the wicked.

>My knees give way from fasting; my body is thin and gaunt

>The priest whomsoever they shall anoint shall make atonement, and whomsoever they shall consecrate to exercise the priestly office after his father; and he shall put on the linen robe, the holy garment.

>I was sleeping and my heart was awake. The voice of my love who was knocking: "Open to me, my sister, my intimate, my innocent dove, for my head is filled with dew and my curls from drops of the night

>Lord, my heart is not arrogant, nor do I look haughty. I do not aspire to great things, nor concern myself with things beyond my ability. Instead, I have composed and quieted myself like a weaned child with its mother; I am like a weaned child.

>By slothful neglect a building will be brought low: and by idleness of the hands the house will fall to pieces.

>And outside are fornicators, murderers, idol worshipers, the defiled, sorcerers and all seers and workers of lies.

>I worked for you through the scorching heat of the day and through cold and sleepless nights.

>The trees went to anoint a king over them: and they said to the olive tree: Reign thou over us. And it answered: Can I leave my fatness, which both gods and men make use of, to come to be promoted among the trees?

>I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the level. Hail will sweep away your refuge of lies, and water will flood your hiding place. Your covenant with death will be dissolved, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand.

>with fasting, weeping, and lamenting tear your heart, not your garments

>Look! They are one people with the same language for all of them, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. Nothing that they have a mind to do will be impossible for them!

>And the Scribes shall continue and they shall say to the people: 'Who is the man whose heart is afraid and fainthearted? Let him return, let him go to his house, lest he will subvert the heart of his brothers as his own'.

>Woe to them! for they have started aside from me: they are cowards; for they have sinned against me: yet I redeemed them, but they spoke falsehoods against me

>Say to the cowardly: "Be strong; do not fear! Here is your God; vengeance is coming. God's retribution is coming; he will save you."

>Do not give yourself as security because you are shamed before people.

>Now people swear oaths by someone greater than themselves, and confirmation of an oath puts an end to all dispute.

>Keep falsehood and futility far from me, and give me neither poverty nor wealth, yes, provide just the food I need today;

>And it was that when day had dawned, and he shook off his wine, his wife told him these matters, and his heart died within him and it was like a stone

>But why should we be happy that we have given you these gifts? They belong to you, and we have only given back what is already yours.

>All their neighbors helped them by giving them many things: silver utensils, gold, supplies, pack animals, other valuables, and offerings for the Temple.

>It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.'

>Is any good you may have done at all helpful to Him?

>And they are dogs whose soul is greedy, and they do not know how to be satisfied. They shall be evil and they do not know understanding. All of them turned to their way, each man to this side and to that side

>The wise man will live as long as he ought, not as long as he can

>No one knows himself. It is only by the consequences of his actions, by the fruit of his labors, that a man can judge what he is to expect.

>Let your food be your medicine and your medicine be your food

>When diet is wrong, medicine is of no use. When diet is correct, medicine is of no need.

>What are a billion years compared to eternity? Not even a glimmer. Why, then, do we scramble after such short-lived earthly goals, goals that even if attained prove to be worthless since they vanish away so quickly? Why do we continually deny our eternity and affirm the delusion of temporality? Because we identify thoroughly with that which is temporal and finite.

>Once an enemy, never a friend, not even after death

>Don't even mention the name of their gods, let alone have people swear by them, serve them, or worship them

>When our enemies heard that the plot was known to us, and God had foiled their plans, we all returned to the wall, everyone to his work

>Fight for your brothers, sons, daughters, wives, and homes

>If you plan and work hard, you will have plenty; if you hurry to get rich, you will end up poor

>My wife can't stand my breath, I am loathsome to my own family. Even young children despise me &mdash; if I stand up, they start jeering at me. All my intimate friends abhor me, and those I loved have turned against me. My bones stick to my flesh; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.

>Though his face is covered with fat and his waistline bulges with flesh, he will dwell in ruined cities, in abandoned houses destined to become rubble

>It must not be used to anoint an ordinary man, and you must not make anything like it with the same formula. It is holy, and it must be holy to you.

>They must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink vinegar made from wine or other fermented drink. They must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.

>You shall not deny justice to the poor in their lawsuits. Stay far away from a false accusation. Do not kill the innocent or the just, for I will not acquit the guilty. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the righteous.

>Ransom me from the oppression of man, and I observe Your precepts

>My father! If the prophet had asked you to do something really difficult, wouldn't you have done it? So, doesn't it make even more sense to do what he says, when it's only, 'Bathe, and be clean'?

>Surely none who wait for You will be put to shame; but those who are faithless without cause will be disgraced.

>But you, return to your God, and keep grace and judgment; expect your God constantly

>I have waited for good and evil came; I have waited for the light, and blackness came

>And like a Servant who waits for the shade, and like a hired man who waits to finish his work

>Do not rely on a friend; do not trust in a companion. Seal the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your arms.

>The men who have been invoking your peace deceived you and prevailed over you and sank your feet into the mud, and they have turned their tail

>Even your brother or your son or your daughter or the wife you love or your closest friend may secretly encourage you to worship other gods, gods that you and your ancestors have never worshiped.

>Your allies can't be trusted. They will force you out of your own country. And your best friends will trick and trap you, even before you know it.

>Indeed, your written instructions make me happy. They are my best friends.

>Next, I decided to consider wisdom, as well as foolish behavior and ideas. For what more can the king's successor do than what the king has already done?

>When the day's cool breeze comes up and the shadows lengthen, I will get myself to the mountain of myrrh, to the hill of frankincense

>The mandrakes have given a fragrance, and all our fruits, new ones and old ones, my beloved, I have kept for you upon our gates

>God sends rain to water the earth; he may send it to punish us, or to show us his favor.

>You will sweat all your life to earn a living; you were made out of soil, and you will once again turn into soil.

>My tears have been food for me by day and by night, while they have been saying to me every day, "Where is your God?"

>Let their table be a snare before them, and their reward a stumbling block.

>I sigh when food is put before me, and my groans pour out like water.

>Yeshua said to them, “My personal food is that I do the will of him who has sent me and finish His work

>Therefore, remember where you were before you fell, and turn from this sin, and do what you used to do before.

>I'll fall on him unexpectedly when he's tired and powerless, I'll frighten him, all the people will flee, and I'll attack only the king. Then I will bring back to you all the people; and when they have returned, except the one you are seeking, all the people will be at peace

>As for me, I will hope continuously and will praise you more and more.

>Who can hear what God is saying And receive the knowledge that comes from the Most High. With staring eyes I see in a trance A vision from Almighty God.

>Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to another, and he will lie with them in broad daylight. You have acted in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.

>If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle.

>You are not to make a covenant with them or with their gods.

>Do not follow the crowd when it does what is wrong

>But if you listen to what he says and do everything I tell you, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foes.

>Cursed is everyone who will divert the judgment of a settler or of an orphan or of a widow, and all the people shall say, "Amen."

>Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their misfortune and to keep oneself unstained by the world.

>A king's greatness depends on how many people he rules; without them he is nothing.

>In the abundance of the evil ones, evil increases, and the righteous will rejoice in their fall.

>I was with the weak as weak that I might gain the weak. I was everything to every person that I might give life to every person.

>If one does not repent, God will sharpen His sword; He has bent and strung His bow

>Every person works for his own self-interests, but his desires remain unsatisfied.

>And he shall cut up on his right and he shall hunger and he shall eat on his left, and they shall not be satisfied; a man shall eat the flesh of his own arm

>Because he did not know his judgment in his gut, and by his lusts he will not escape

>All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

>Here is someone who lives alone. He has no son, no brother, yet he is always working, never satisfied with the wealth he has. For whom is he working so hard and denying himself any pleasure? This is useless, too--and a miserable way to live.

>But the just Lord is in the midst of her, and he will never do an unjust thing: morning by morning he will bring out his judgment to the light, and it is not hidden, and he knows not injustice by extortion, nor injustice in strife.

>The people ask, "Why should we fast if the Lord never notices? Why should we go without food if he pays no attention?" The Lord says to them, "The truth is that at the same time you fast, you pursue your own interests and oppress your workers."

>So we went without food and asked God himself to protect us, and he answered our prayers.

>Ask all the people of the land and the priests, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted?

>O my people, I ask no recompense of you for it: My reward is with Him who created me

>Better is a name than good perfume, And the day of death than the day of birth.

>If they don't know how to control their own families, how can they look after God's people?

>And startle whomever of them you can with your voice, and rally against them your horsemen and your foot (soldiers); and be a partner with them in (their) riches and (their) children, and promise them!

>So We listened to him: and We granted him Yahya: We cured his wife's (Barrenness) for him. These (three) were ever quick in emulation in good works; they used to call on Us with love and reverence, and humble themselves before Us.

>Verily, those who accuse chaste women, who never even think of anything touching their chastity and are good believers - are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter, and for them will be a great torment

>Uphold the faith and do not divide into factions within it

>But if his shirt is torn from behind, then that is an indication that he is truthful, because she was trying to seduce him whilst he was running away; and she will be lying.

>He is the One Who creates you in different forms in the wombs of your mothers, as He wills: as male and female, handsome and ugly, black and white. There is no one worthy of being worshipped with love and reverence besides Him. He is Mighty and cannot be overpowered. He is Wise in His planning and legislation.

>O children of Adam! Do not let Satan deceive you as he tempted your parents out of Paradise and caused their cover to be removed in order to expose their nakedness. Surely he and his soldiers watch you from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils allies of those who disbelieve.

> And he to whom Satan is a companion - then evil is he as a companion.
> 
>Those who distance themselves from major and offensive sins and when they are angry at those who offend them by words or deeds they forgive their mistake and do not punish them for it. This pardon is a grace they offer when there is goodness and benefit in it.

>Leave Me Alone (to deal) with whom I created lonely (without any wealth or children. And then granted him resources in abundance. And children to be by his side. And made life smooth and comfortable for him.  After all that he desires that I should give more

>Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; But turn away from the ignorant.

>Those who spend their wealth in charity, day and night, in secret and in public; they will have their reward with their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve.

>Remove far from me vanity and falsehood: and give me not wealth or poverty; but appoint me what is needful and sufficient

>Woe to me! I wish I had not taken so-and-so for a close friend

>If I betray him, I will be a wrongdoer; and those who do wrong do not succeed.

>If you have reason to fear from a people betrayal, throw their treaty back to them, putting you on equal terms.

>As a result of their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard

>So, verily, with every difficulty, there is relief: verily, with every difficulty, there is relief: Therefore, when thou art free (from thine immediate task), still labour hard, And to thy Lord turn (all) thy attention.

>We have created everything in due proportion. Our command comes only once, in the twinkling of an eye!

>I want to let you bear your sin against me along with your other sins, then you will be one of those destined to the Fire. And that is the reward of the wrongdoers.

>And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And if a heavily laden soul calls [another] to [carry some of] its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if he should be a close relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen and have established prayer. And whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for [the benefit of] his soul.

>Those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations, save the unwilled offences - (for them) lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy. He is Best Aware of you (from the time) when He created you from the earth, and when ye were hidden in the bellies of your mothers. Therefor ascribe not purity unto yourselves. He is Best Aware of him who wardeth off (evil).

>And do not become like the woman who, after having painstakingly spun her yarn, caused it to disintegrate into pieces. You resort to oaths as instruments of mutual deceit so that one people might take greater advantage than another

>He knows all that lies open before them and all that lies hidden from them; whereas they cannot attain to anything of His knowledge save as He wills.

>My people, the life of this world is ephemeral, whereas the Hereafter, that is the permanent abode. Whosoever does an evil deed will be requited only with the like of it; and whosoever acts righteously and has attained to faith be he a male or a female they shall enter Paradise and be provided sustenance beyond all reckoning.

>Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is Best Aware of those who walk aright. Therefor obey not thou the rejecters, Who would have had thee compromise, that they may compromise. Neither obey thou each feeble oath-monger, Detracter, spreader abroad of slanders, Hinderer of the good, transgressor, malefactor, Greedy therewithal, intrusive. It is because he is possessed of wealth and children. That, when Our revelations are recited unto him, he saith: Mere fables of the men of old.

>He and his purchaser will then count the time from the year he sold himself up to the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years, based on the daily wages of a hired hand. If many years remain, he must pay for his redemption in proportion to his purchase price. If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he is to calculate and pay his redemption according to his remaining years. He shall be treated like a man hired from year to year, but a foreign owner must not rule over him harshly in your sight.

>Indeed many who live together commit excesses, one to the other, except those that believe and act righteously; and they are but few.

>As for man, when his Lord tests him, and thus gives him honour and bounties, he says, "My Lord has honoured me." But when he tests him, and thus straitens his provision for him, he says, "My Lord has disgraced me. No! But you do not honour the orphan, and do not encourage one another to feed the needy, And you devour the inheritance with a sweeping gulp, and love wealth, with an excessive love.

>Whoever kills a person not (to retaliate) for a per-son killed nor (to punish) for spreading disorder in the earth, is as if he has killed the whole mankind, and whoever saves the life of a person is as if he has saved the life of the whole mankind. 

>Remain and be close with your poor companions who sincerely call on their Lord in worship and supplication at the beginning and at the end of the day. Do not let your eyes overlook them intending to sit with people of affluence and prestige. Do not follow the one whose heart I have made neglectful of Our remembrance by sealing it and who instructed you to remove the poor from your gathering giving preference to following his desire over following His Lord. His actions and deeds are thus foolish, excessive and in vain.

>Believers, avoid being excessively suspicious, for some suspicion is a sin. Do not spy, nor backbite one another.

>Keep yourself content with those who call upon their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His pleasure, and do not let your eyes pass beyond them. 

>Who causes glad songs to ring out at night

>Do you seek the pomp and glitter of the world? Do not follow him whose heart We have caused to be heedless of Our remembrance, and who follows his desires, and whose attitude is of excess.

>Souls have been naturally created with greed and miserliness, and will not be keen to give up any right.

>And I endued thee with love from Me that thou mightest be trained according to My will

>The enjoyment of the life of the world which lasts only for a short while. A believer should not become attached to these things

>We made the day and night as two signs. So We made the sign of the night devoid of light, and We made the sign of the day ˹perfectly˺ bright, so that you may seek the bounty of your Lord and know the number of years and calculation ˹of time˺. And We have explained everything in detail. ˹And it will be said,˺ "Read your record. You ˹alone˺ are sufficient this Day to take account of yourself." 

>Whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. And We would never punish a people until We have sent a messenger to warn them.

>Man was truly created anxious: he is fretful when misfortune touches him, but tight-fisted when good fortune comes his way.

>Surely the wasteful are ˹like˺ brothers to the devils. And the Devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord.

>Do not be so tight-fisted, for you will be blameworthy; nor so open-handed, for you will end up in poverty.

>Do not follow blindly what you do not know to be true: ears, eyes, and heart, you will be questioned about all these.

>Do not strut arrogantly about the earth: you cannot break it open, nor match the mountains in height.

>And when they encounter those who have attained faith, they say, "We have attained faith." But when they are alone with their Satans, they say, "We are indeed with you; we are only ridiculing."

>But all things We have enumerated in writing.

>But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.

>And if We had pleased, We would certainly have exalted him thereby; but he clung to the earth and followed his low desire, so his parable is as the parable of the dog; if you attack him he lolls out his tongue; and if you leave him alone he lolls out his tongue; this is the parable of the people who reject Our communications; therefore relate the narrative that they may reflect.

>And if the debtor is in straitened circumstances, then (let there be) postponement to (the time of) ease; and that ye remit the debt as almsgiving would be better for you if ye did but know.

>And those who, before them, had homes and had adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to them, and have no jealousy in their breasts for that which they have been given, and give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that. And whosoever is saved from his own covetousness, such are they who will be the successful.

>Take what is given freely, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant.

>Say to them, the death you try to flee from will meet you; then you will be conveyed back to him who knows the unseen and the witnessed. Then he will inform you of all that you have done

>O you who have believed, spend from that which We have provided for you before there comes a Day in which there is no exchange and no friendship and no intercession. And the disbelievers - they are the wrongdoers.

>The example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries &mdash; cattle or sheep &mdash; deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand.

>The example of the two parties is like the blind and deaf, and the seeing and hearing. Are they equal in comparison? Then, will you not remember?

>Indeed, they who have believed and done righteous deeds and humbled themselves to their Lord - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide eternally therein.

>Indeed, you will not make the dead hear, nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they have turned their backs retreating.

>And say, "My Lord, cause me to enter a sound entrance and to exit a sound exit and grant me from Yourself a supporting authority.

>truly many are the partners (in business) who wrong each other: Not so do those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and how few are they?

>And whoever is blinded from remembrance of the Most Merciful - We appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a companion.

>O believers, among your wives and children there is an enemy to you; so beware of them. But if you pardon, and overlook, and if you forgive, surely God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.

>And when you look at them, their bodies please you; and when they speak, you listen to their words. They are as blocks of wood propped up. They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies, so beware of them.

>The mutual rivalry for piling up of worldly things diverts you until you come to the graves.

>No reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me for my kinship with you.

>Listen and obey and spend in charity for the benefit of your own soul. And those saved from the covetousness of their own souls, they are the ones that achieve prosperity.

>Let the well-to-do people spend abundantly (for the mother and the child) and let the poor spend from what God has given them. God does not impose on any soul that which he cannot afford. God will bring about ease after hardship.

>They fight not against you even together, except in fortified townships, or from behind walls. Their enmity among themselves is very great

>He says, "I have spent wealth in abundance." Does he think that no one has seen him? Have We not made for him two eyes? And a tongue and two lips? And have shown him the two ways? But he has not broken through the difficult pass. And what can make you know what is the difficult pass? It is the freeing of a slave. Or feeding on a day of severe hunger an orphan of near relationship or a needy person in misery. And then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one another to compassion. Those are the companions of the right. But they who disbelieved in Our signs - those are the companions of the left.

>Those who do wrong conceal their private conversation

>So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their Day which they are promised.

>Will you exchange that which is better for that which is worse?

>And indeed, for you in grazing livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from what is in their bellies - between excretion and blood - pure milk, palatable to drinkers.

>So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life

>O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous

>You must make it clear to the people and not conceal it.

>Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - never would the capacity of the earth in gold be accepted from one of them if he would ransom himself with it. For those there will be a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers.

>And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear Me.

>And among the People of the Scripture is he who, if you entrust him with a great amount, he will return it to you. And among them is he who, if you entrust him with a silver coin, he will not return it to you unless you are constantly standing over him

>Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire - of women and sons, heaped-up sums of gold and silver, fine branded horses, and cattle and tilled land.

>The best man for employment is definitely the strong and trustworthy

>And test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age. Then if you perceive in them sound judgement, release their property to them. And do not consume it excessively and quickly, [anticipating] that they will grow up. And whoever, is self-sufficient should refrain; and whoever is poor - let him take according to what is acceptable. Then when you release their property to them, bring witnesses upon them.

>You will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves

>And do not give the weak-minded your property

>And let not their wealth and their children impress you.

>And [for] their taking of usury while they had been forbidden from it, and their consuming of the people's wealth unjustly. And we have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.

>And give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute the defective [of your own] for the good [of theirs]. And do not consume their properties into your own. Indeed, that is ever a great sin.

>How [can there be a treaty] while, if they gain dominance over you, they do not observe concerning you any pact of kinship or covenant of protection? They satisfy you with their mouths, but their hearts refuse [compliance], and most of them are defiantly disobedient.

>But their sin is greater than their benefit

>And they ask you what they should spend. Say, "The excess" 

>And whatever strikes you of disaster - it is for what your hands have earned; but He pardons much.

>They said, "If we had known [there would be] fighting, we would have followed you." They were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts.

>And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make settlement between the two. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses

>So let them laugh a little and weep much as recompense for what they used to earn.

>How can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?

>Every good and perfect gift descends from above, from The Father of lights with whom there is no change nor a shadow of variation.

>The Spirit is The Life Giver; the body does not benefit anything. The words that I speak with you are spirit and life.

>Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with their heart and their soul there is no such thing as separation

>the ax forgets the tree remembers

>If we are irritated by every rub, how will we be polished

>for a covenant is affirmed at death, since it is not in force at all when the [one] having made [it] lives

>who created you from weakness, then made after weakness strength, then made after strength weakness and white hair

>all human beings were created weak

>Buy and sell until I come.

>And this is the basic law of the Temple: absolute holiness!

>If one offered for love all the wealth of one's house, it would be utterly scorned.

>Unlike the other high priests, He does not need to offer daily sacrifices

>Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt

>Health is the greatest gift, contentment is the greatest wealth, a trusted friend is the best relative

>And so it shall come to pass, that when the jubilee, that is, the fiftieth year of remission, is come, the distribution made by the lots shall be confounded, and the possession of the one shall pass to the others.

>Because it is the jubilee and the fiftieth year. You shall not sow, nor reap the things that grow in the field of their own accord, neither shall you gather the firstfruits of the vines

>And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom [for the slaves] throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee (year of remission) for you, and each of you shall return to his own [ancestral] property [that was sold to another because of poverty], and each of you shall return to his family [from whom he was separated by bondage]

>Your evil is to your soul, and to your soul is your righteousness

>who made us, who gives ideas in the night

>sometimes a person needs what he does not own and he owns what he does not need

>The skinny cows ate the fat ones

>Cush causes her hands to run to God.

>You shall not be afraid of the reproach of man, and you shall not tremble at their insults

>Like a moth, you destroy what we treasure most.

>But when he gave them from His bounty, they were stingy with it and turned away while they refused. So He penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the Day they will meet Him

>It won't obey anyone. It won't accept discipline.

>Lo, in His holy ones He putteth no credence, And the heavens have not been pure in His eyes.

>Should I prostrate to one You created from clay?

>For beware of wrath when abundance entices you; don't let a big bribe turn you aside

>God rescues the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ears in oppression
